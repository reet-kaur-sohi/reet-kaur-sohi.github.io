    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Reet Sohi. I’m in grade 8 at Khalsa Secondary School. I was born in Surrey, BC and I’m 13 years old. I started high school this year and I’m really enjoying it. 
Some of my favorite classes are science, Sikh music, woodworking, P.E. and media arts. I love listening to music, watching Youtube, shopping and baking. I also like to hang out with my friends and learn new things. A fun fact about me is that I’m an only child.</p>
